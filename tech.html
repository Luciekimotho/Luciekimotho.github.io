    <h3>Laser Pointer Hack Easily Dupes Driverless Cars. </h3> 
<p>A simple off-the-shelf laser pointer could be combined with a very basic computer to disrupt the multithousand-dollar laser ranging, or Lidar, systems installed in most self-driving cars, a security researcher warned last week.

A setup that costs about US$60 could trick the Lidar system, which autonomous vehicles use to sense objects in the road, into responding as though there were obstacles ahead in situations where there were none, said Jonathan Petit, principal scientist at Security Innovation.

That type of hack wouldn't cause the driverless car to crash, but it could force the vehicle to slow down or even stop. In a worst-case scenario, the spurious signals could force an autonomous vehicle to remain stationary due to its sensing of phantom obstacles.

Petit, who recently joined Security Innovation, co-authored a paper describing a proof-of-concept attack, based on experiments carried out while he was a research fellow at the University of Cork's Computer Security Group. The paper, "Potential Cyberattacks on Automated Vehicles," by Petit and Steven E. Shladover, who was a master's student at the university when he worked on the project, is slated for presentation at the Black Hat Europe security conference in November. </p>
    <p>he researchers sought to test the vulnerabilities of autonomous vehicles -- notably their sensors, which appeared to be the technologies most susceptible to a simple attack. To actually hack the systems, they developed a simple setup that included a low-power laser and a pulse generator.

In previous research, hackers had attempted to spoof a self-driving car's GPS devices or wireless tire sensors. However, the Cork team aimed to create a problem by making the sensors detect something that actually wasn't there.

"The outcome was to create fake objects that would be detected by the Lidar system," Petit told TechNewsWorld.

The sensors in the system rely on a classifier to determine what an object might be, he added.

"All these sensors will detect noise, and nothing is 100 percent reliable, but if the Lidar picked up some reflections, it will basically try to do a check and determine if there is in fact a problem," Petit explained.

The hack affects the Lidar system only. Cameras and other vehicle sensors used to confirm that there is in fact an object ahead are unaffected. </p>

    <h3> What tech workers hate about their jobs</h3>
    <p>There's no question about it, working in the tech industry can be a high-paying job filled with perks and benefits.

But there are some big downsides to the job, particularly for IT pros â€” the folks in companies that oversee employees' devices, networks and apps.

Several recent surveys document the ways in which IT pros are unhappy. These include a survey of 5,000 people from TinyPulse, an HR service that attempts to prevent worker burnout; a survey of 214 people from SolarWinds, known for its huge social network for IT professionals; of 23,000 from job-hunting site Dice; and of 4,900 from IT magazine Computerworld.
